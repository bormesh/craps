<h1>Craps! How to win everytime!*</h1>

<h2>The pass bet</h2>

<p>This might not be the easiest bet for a newbie to learn, but
it's the best place to start. Craps is a game of points. There
is one person who rolls the dice. He's called the <strong>shooter</strong>
You'll often see the shooter in television
commercials for casinos (the person with the impish smile and two
girls in shiny dresses to either side). The goal of shooter is
to make as many points as possible.</p>

<p>So first off, what's a point?

<strong>Points are</strong> the numbers <strong>4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10</strong>.
Points are made by the shooter rolling the dice and the two numbers adding up together
to one of the points. </p>

<p>Ok, straightforward so far. Now here's the wrinkle. Craps is played in rounds, where
a round is ended when the shooter gives the dice to the next player in line. There are
two phases to a round, the <strong>come-out</strong> phase and the <strong> point </strong>
phase.</p>

<h3>Come-out Phase</h3>

<p>
The goal of the come-out phase is to establish a point. That is, the player is
trying to roll one of the numbers above that we have established as points (4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10).

<p>You may ask yourself, what about the other numbers? namely 2, 3, 7, 11, and 12? These numbers
are not points. They can all be good or bad depending on the bet. In the come-out phase, the a player
must bet on the <strong>pass line</strong> or the <strong>do not pass line</strong>.

<p>Let's say the shooter has put $10 down on the <strong>pass line</strong>. There are 3 outcomes from
any roll when we are in the come-out phase and the shooter has money bet on the <strong>pass line</strong>.

<ol>
 <li> The shooter rolls one of the points (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10) and the game enters the next phase.
      The money on the pass line stays put
 </li>

 <li> The shooter rolls a 7 or 11 (in this case, called a <strong>natural</strong>.
      This is a win for anyone with money on the pass line. Our shooter wins $10 (how much he had on the past line).
      He is still the shooter and must roll again, but now he's got $10 more!
 </li>

 <li> The shooter rolls a 2, 3, or 12. This is where the game gets it's name as this roll is called <strong>craps</strong>.
      Anyone with money on the pass line loses the money. So our shooter loses his $10. If the shooter wishes
